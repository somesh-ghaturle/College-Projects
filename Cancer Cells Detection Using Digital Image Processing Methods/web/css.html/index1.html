        <p>WAMP or WampServer is a compilation of Apache web server, PHP and MySQL bundled for Windows computers. Basically, you need WAMP to setup your own local server environment and install WordPress on Windows. There are other clients for Windows such as XAMPP, but we use and recommend WAMP. It is free and easy to use</p>
        
        <p>WordPress will quickly run the installation and create database tables. Once done, you will see a success message after the installation. You can then proceed to your WordPress by clicking on the Log in button. </p>

        <p>If you have Skype installed and running then WampServer may not be able to work properly due to a conflict with Skype. The conflict is caused by both Apache and Skype using the same port 80. There is a simple fix for this problem. Open Skype and go to Tools Â» Options. Click on Advanced and then Connections. Uncheck the box that says Use port 80 and 443 as alternatives for incoming connections. Save options and restart Skype. </p>

        <p>After numerous request via twitter, facebook, email, and comments in this post, we have written a guide on how to move WordPress from WAMP local server to a live site. Hopefully you guys will find it helpful when you are ready to deploy your local site to production.

        We hope that this article helped you install WordPress on your Windows computer using WAMP. Having a local server environment is great for learning and testing purposes. Remember, if you want to run a blog for other people to see, then you do not need to install WordPress on your computer. You need to install WordPress on a web hosting provider. If you have any questions, then please feel free to ask in the comments below.</p>
